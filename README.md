# FPS (First Person Sight)

This is a really simple first person game where you need to leave a maze.

- Press WASD keys to move your character
- Hold shift to run
- Move your mouse and the camera moves together
- Press ESC to quit the game

This game was written using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), so you'll need to install it in your machine in order to compile it.

When you've already done this, simply compile:
```sh
gcc fps.c -o fps -lraylib -lm
```

And run:
```sh
./fps
```

You may need to move your mouse cursor to inside the game screen before being able to control the camera.
